      <i>Ever since i was a kid i was impressed by computers and how they worked i always saw my siblings using them and i wondered how do they work, and i was watching them playing games, i always wondered if i could make some games one day, as a kid i would play lots of games, and look into thier source code to see how they work. my favorite games as a kid were, league of legends, valorant, and roblox, my first game engine i used was roblox studio, i really enjoyed the process, at the time i was watching some of the best animes and i made a few anime games, like one piece ones, my second game engine i used was a web based game engine called playcanvas, i was there under the username fus_ion, i later moved onto unity, and i am now getting into unreal engine, i want to see where i go in the future of programming 4 years from now.</i>
